*DOMAIN*: CYBERSECURITY AND ETHICAL HACKING

*DURATION* : 4 WEEKS

## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK : THIS TASK INVOLVES BUILDING A FILE INTEGRITY CHECKER TOOL USING PYTHON. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ENSURE THE SECURITY AND CONSISTENCY OF FILES BY MONITORING CHANGES OVER TIME THROUGH THE 
USE OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH FUNCTIONS. 
## PURPOSE IS TO DETECT UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS, CORRUPTION, OR TAMPERING OF FILES BY COMPARING THEIR CURRENT HASH VALUES WITH PREVIOUSLY RECORDED HASHES.
## WHAT THE TOOL DOES: 1.SCANS A FOLDER AND CALCULATES THE SHA256 HASH OF EACH FILE. 2. STORES THE HASH VALUES IN A JSON FILE. 3. ON FUTURE RUNS,IT RECALCULATES EACH FILE'S HASH AND COMPARES IT TO THE SAVED ONE.
4. IF ANY HASH DOESN'T MATCH , THE TOOL REPORTS THE FILE AS MODIFIED
## TECHNOLOGIES USED : PYTHON , HASHLIB-TO GENERATE SHA256HASHES , OS-FOR DIRECTORY AND FILE TRAVERSAL ,JSON-FOR SAVING AND LOADING HASH RECORDS
## EXPECTED OUTPUT : A TERMINAL REPORT SHOWING WHICH FILES ARE : [UNCHANGED] - SAME AS BEFORE ; [MODIFIED] - CHANGED SINCE LAST SCAN , A SAVED FILE: file_hashes.json ,CONTAING THE HASH RECORDS.
## DELIVERABLE : A PYTHON SCRIPT(file_integrity_checker.py)THAT USES HASHLIB TO MONITOR AND VERIFY FILE INTEGRITY.
